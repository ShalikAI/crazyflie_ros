All the experiments were performed & executed in python & ROS. 

## Crazyflie Position Tracking with Opti Track
The diagram visually represents a motion capture network setup featuring a central network switch connected to two PCs. One PC operates on Ubuntu with ROS, and the other runs Windows with Motive software. Seven OptiTrack Prime 17W cameras are connected to the network switch, indicating an expanded motion capture setup compared to the original four cameras. The connections are displayed through a LAN, with dotted lines to the PCs and solid lines to the cameras, illustrating a professional and balanced network configuration suitable for motion capture applications for position tracking of the crazyflie.

## Crazyflie API
This README provides instructions for working with Crazyflies on Ubuntu, including running the Crazyflie program, understanding the Crazyflie tutorial, and various commands for controlling the Crazyflie drone.

## Running the Crazyflie Program
To run the Crazyflie client, use the following command:
```bash
python3 -m cfclient.gui
```

## Crazyflie Tutorial
- Communication URI: `radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7`
- Crazyradio PA
  - CRTP (Crazyradio Real-Time Protocol)
  - Medium: Radio used
  - Channel: 10-120
  - Speed: Communication speed in bits per second
  - Address: Address of the individual Crazyflie drone
- Broadcasting to multiple Crazyflies is possible on the same channel.

## Internal Measurement Unit (IMU)
- Accelerometers: Measures acceleration in xyz directions.
- Gyroscope: Measures angular movement.
- Pressure Sensor: Used for height estimation (barometer is off by default).

## Additional Information
- Maximum carrying weight: 15 grams.
- Flow deck can fly up to 4 meters or 13 feet.
- 30x30 pixel camera on the flow deck with a 4.2-degree field of view.
- Initial coordinates are set where the Crazyflie starts.

## Swarm Control
- Broadcasting: Sending messages with no return expected.
- Supports multiple Crazyflies per Crazyradio using the same channel.
- Specific trajectories cannot be sent at each time step.
- Crazyflies need to autonomously handle more tasks.

## Flashing Multiple Crazyflies
- Go to `examples/demos/swarm_demo`.
- Include geometry settings.
- Use the `.sh` script for flashing all drones: `./cload_all.sh`.

## Crazyflie Movement Commands
### Synchronization and Motion
```python
with SyncCrazyflie(URI) as scf:
    with MotionCommander(scf) as mc:
        # Movement commands here
```
### Using the Flow Deck for Localization
- The drone maintains height relative to the surface beneath the flow deck.
- The flow deck may have stability issues at high speeds, especially in circles.
- Refer to the Crazyflie Python library for more details: [Crazyflie Documentation](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/api/cflib/positioning/motion_commander/)

### Motion Commander
- Default height for takeoff: `MotionCommander(crazyflie, default_height=0.3)`
- Parameters:
  - `crazyflie`: A Crazyflie or SyncCrazyflie instance.
  - `default_height`: Default height for flying.

### Basic Movement Functions
- `move_distance(self, distance_x_m, distance_y_m, distance_z_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move in a straight line.
- `start_linear_motion(self, velocity_x_m, velocity_y_m, velocity_z_m, rate_yaw=0.0)`: Start a linear motion with optional yaw rate.

### Start/Stop Functions
- `take_off(self, height=None, velocity=0.2)`: Takeoff function.
- `stop(self)`: Stop any motion and hover.
- `land(self, velocity=0.2)`: Land the drone.

### Movement in Different Directions
- `up(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move up.
- `down(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move down.
- `forward(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move forward.
- `back(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move backward.
- `left(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move left.
- `right(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move right.

### Circular Movements
- `circle_left(self, radius_m, velocity=0.2, angle_degrees=360.0)`: Circle counter-clockwise.
- `circle_right(self, radius_m, velocity=0.2, angle_degrees=360.0)`: Circle clockwise.

### Left Movements
- `left(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move to the left.
- `start_left(self, velocity=0.2)`: Start moving left immediately.
- `turn_left(self, angle_degrees, rate=72.0)`: Turn left on the spot.
- `start_turn_left(self, rate=72.0)`: Begin turning left immediately.
- `circle_left(self, radius_m, velocity=0.2, angle_degrees=360.0)`: Circle counter-clockwise.
- `start_circle_left(self, radius_m, velocity=0.2)`: Start circular motion to the left immediately.

### Right Movements
- `right(self, distance_m, velocity=0.2)`: Move to the right.
- `start_right(self, velocity=0.2)`: Start moving right immediately.
- `turn_right(self, angle_degrees, rate=72.0)`: Turn right on the spot.
